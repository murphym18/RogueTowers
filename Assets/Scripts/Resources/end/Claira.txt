Tyrem Look's like you all have been doing just fine since I've left.
Claira	Well, for the most part, but we would still love to have you back...
Tyrem	I know. And one day, maybe. 
Tyrem	But for now, let's just get everyone off this rock and home safely.
Claira	Sounds like a plan! Here, take my Bishop tower - it's sure to be quite useful!
Tyrem	Thanks sis. Now let's go fulfill your predictions of me saving everyone.
