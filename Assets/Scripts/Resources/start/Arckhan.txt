Arckhan	Oh hey Son, how's it shakin'!
Tyrem	Hey Pops. Taking in the sites?
Arckhan	Oh you know it! 
Arckhan	This place looked pretty good at first, but now I'm getting bored. 
Arckhan	You showed up just in the knick of time!
Tyrem	I'm just that good. Come on, let's go.
Arckhan	Hey, why don't we double team this, just like old time!
Tyrem	Nah. Remember? I've gone solo. 
Tyrem	I don't wanna live just by the fame of my last name. 
Tyrem	So while I can't let my family stay in danger, I'm still gonna do things my way.
Arckah	Oh fine, if you insist, but just know your killing the party! AHA HA HA!
