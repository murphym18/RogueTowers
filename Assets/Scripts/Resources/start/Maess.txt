Maess	Oh hey there Tyrem!
Tyrem	Hey Mom, how ya doing.
Maess	Oh just peachy. How bout you?
Tyrem	Just fine, just fine.
Maess	So, the other's weren't able to escape on their own, huh?
Tyrem	Nope.
Maess	Oh well. I was hoping that they could get out without my or your father's help. 
Maess	But it looks like you'll be the one to save us all.
Tyrem	I figured you two were just allowing the kids to get some practice. 
Tyrem	But I came just in case it was too dangerous. I'd say I was right.
Maess	Oh really? Well, then I'm doubly glad you're here. 
Maess	Now you can get even stronger saving us. Here, take my tower, 
Maess	it's sure to demolish anything you encounter.
Tyrem	Thanks Mom. See ya for dinner!
Maess	Bye son! Supper is at 7pm!
