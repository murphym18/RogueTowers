Maess	Oh hey there Tyrem!
Tyrem	Hey Mom, how ya doing.
Maess	Oh just peachy. How bout you?
Tyrem	Just fine, just fine.
Maess	So, the other's weren't able to escape on their own, huh?
Tyrem	Nope.
Maess	Oh well. I was hoping that they could get out without my or your father's help. 
Maess	But it looks like you'll be the one to save us all.
Tyrem	I figured you two were just allowing the kids to get some practice. 
Tyrem	But I came just in case it was too dangerous. I'd say I was right.
