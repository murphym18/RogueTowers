Tyrem	Hey, you one of the guys that are keeping the Castellum family here? 
Tyrem	On this rock, floating out in the middle of nowhere, no less?
Enemy	*Twim twim! Hil cen yu ban!*
Tyrem	... Well... I'll take that as a yes. 
Tyrem	And since I probably won't be able to get any more info out of you, 
Tyrem	time for you to say goodnight.
Enemy	*Grur grur grur! Miv burs enven!*
Tyrem	What the!? The little guy just went crazy! 
Tyrem	Wait... what is that he's going after...? 
Enemy	*Wimimimigu-ruupuuuuuuu!*
Tyrem	Ah! A cage! 
Tyrem	Look's like that's where my family members are being kept. 
Tyrem	Time to get to work rescuing 'em. 
Tyrem	Ah, I see, it looks like I can open the cage with the ~space bar~, 
Tyrem	just like how I attack. How convenient. Let's do this.
