Dawn	Oh, hey Tyrem! What brings you here?
Tyrem	I heard that my good ole family got in over there heads this time, 
Tyrem	so I felt like lending a hand. 
Dawn	Oh, well that was nice of you! Thanks!
Tyrem	Of course, Dawn. 
Tyrem	I couldn't just let my favorite little Sunshine get eaten my a bunch'a baddies, now could I?
Dawn	D'awwwwww! Well here, 
Dawn	I'll share some sunshine with you! Use my tower to help the others!
Tyrem	Will do, lil sis. Let's go finish rounding up the gang.
Dawn	Ya hoo!
