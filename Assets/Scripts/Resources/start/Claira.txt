Claira	Ah Tyrem, right on time!
Tyrem	Oh hey Claira. You predicted me coming here just about now?
Claira	Yup! After becoming the Castellum's official planner and time manager, 
Claira	I've gotten pretty good predicting what's coming.
Tyrem	Well color me impressed. Look's like you all have been doing just fine since I've left.
Claira	Well, for the most part, but we would still love to have you back...
Tyrem	I know. And one day, maybe. 
Tyrem	But for now, let's just get everyone off this rock and home safely.
Claira	Sounds like a plan! Here, take my Bishop tower - it's sure to be quite useful!
Tyrem	Thanks sis. Now let's go fulfill your predictions of me saving everyone.
